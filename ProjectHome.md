dpix is a viewer for 3D models capable of rendering scenes with non-photorealistic stylization and abstraction.

dpix reads COLLADA .dae files and Google Earth .kmz files. A Google SketchUp ruby script to export suitable COLLADA files is included in the distribution.

**Please Note:** Although dpix is fairly full-featured, it is primarily research software. As such, it may fail to run, crash, or otherwise not perform as expected. It is not intended for regular use in any kind of production pipeline.
